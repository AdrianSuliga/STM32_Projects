# STM32_Projects
Repository holds exercises and projects done on STM32 microcontroller

# ADC exercise
- Exercise 1: Use potentiometer to manipulate blinking frequency of 2 LEDs. 
- Exercise 2: Use value from photoresistor to manipulate brightness of 2 LEDs.
- Exercise 3: Add joystick to previous project. The board should read ADC value from this joystick and send them to PC via UART whenever user moves the stick.

# SPI on MCP23S08
- SPI_Lesson: Project contains all SPI exs from FORBOT course. The aim of those exs was to create library to interact with MCP23S08 port expander.
