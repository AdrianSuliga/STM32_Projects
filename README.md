Repository holds exercises and projects done on STM32 microcontroller

# ADC exercise
- Exercise 1: Use potentiometer to manipulate blinking frequency of 2 LEDs. 
- Exercise 2: Use value from photoresistor to manipulate brightness of 2 LEDs.
- Exercise 3: Add joystick to previous project. The board should read ADC value from this joystick and send them to PC via UART whenever user moves the stick.
